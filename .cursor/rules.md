# Cursor Rules for Modernizing ScoreKeeper

- All plans should be created in `.cursor/plans`.
- All plans should use checkboxes to track the completion state of action items or implementation steps.
- Do not add checkboxes to items that are informational, such as notes or descriptions.
- Use `bash` or `zsh` as the shell for development tasks.
- Any tool scripts should use `bash` as their shell.
- By default, the user will manually run build or test commands and provide the output. However, if the user requests, commands may be run directlyâ€”always show the command and ask for output unless instructed otherwise.
- When creating or updating plans, do not make changes to the project code or files (other than the plan files themselves). Only update plan files to reflect progress or changes.
